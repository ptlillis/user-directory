# user-directory

this application is an attempt to build a react app for an employee search. i am struggling with deployment and have two existing git hub repositories in place for testing.

Ideally, this application should run in the browser after deployment, removing the requirement to clone and install dependencies on a local machine.

The majority of the work here is in creating the react app, building out the components, determining state, and connecting to an outside API. I have more work that I need to do on this assignment prior to deployment, but I am pushing now and will continue working.

My teammate Daniel Meserwat helped me craft this assignment: https://github.com/danny1215/

I also used the Cats App from the class repo to build the components.
